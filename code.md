I am a developer.

I code places on the web. I currently work at <a href="http://keystoneresources.com/" title="Keystone Resources" target="_blank">Keystone Resources</a>.

Here's some other stuff I'm proud of:

*Ruby/Rails, Front-End*

I took the designs from Photoshop into front-end code and implemented the cart and an initial back-end management system in Ruby on Rails.

I did not do the visual or user experience design, although I did work some UX into the weird checkout workflow to make it slightly better.
