I am a developer.

I code places on the web. Most of my good stuff has been done in my role as VP Interactive at <a href="http://keystoneresources.com/" title="Keystone Resources" target="_blank">Keystone Resources</a> and can be seen <a href="http://keystoneresources.com/portfolio/#interactive" title="Keystone Resources Portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.

But also, here's some other stuff I've done:

*Ruby/Rails, Front-End*

I took the designs from Photoshop into front-end code and implement the cart and an initial back-end management system in Ruby on Rails.

I did *not* do the visual or user experience design, although I did work some UX into the weird checkout workflow to make it slightly better.
